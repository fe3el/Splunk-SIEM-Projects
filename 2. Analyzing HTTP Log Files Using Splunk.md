# Analyzing HTTP Log Files Using Splunk SIEM
## Introduction
**HTTP** is the main protocol for web communication. Since almost all web activity passes through HTTP, its logs are valuable for monitoring user behavior, troubleshooting issues, and detecting suspicious activity such as unauthorized access or unusual requests.

In this repository, I demonstrate how to analyze HTTP logs using Splunk, performing basic analysis such as counting top URLs, top user-agents, and status codes to understand traffic patterns and potential threats.

## Steps to Upload Sample HTTP Log Files to Splunk SIEM
### 1. Prepare Sample HTTP Log Files
1. Obtain sample dummy DNS log filei n a suitable format (e.g., text files). from Open Source : (https://github.com/0xrajneesh)
2. Save the sample log files in a directory accessible by the Splunk instance.

### 2. Upload Log Files to Splunk
- Log in to the Splunk web interface (localhost:/8000).
- Navigate to **Add Data**.
- Select **Upload** as the data input method.

### 3. Choose File
- Click on **Select File** and choose the sample HTTP log file we downloaded earlier.
