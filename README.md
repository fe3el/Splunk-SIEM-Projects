# Splunk-SIEM-Projects
## Objective
The Splunk-SIEM Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned


- Basic understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.

### Tools Used


- Splunk Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Kali Linux (Virtual Environment) — Used for experiments, learning Linux commands, and practicing virtualization techniques.
